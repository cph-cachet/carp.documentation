## Requirements
- [Requirements Analysis Document (RAD)](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.documentation/blob/master/docs/BHRP%20Requirements%20Analysis%20Document%20v2.0.pdf): most of the requirements for the CARP platform were derived from a related project: the [Biometric Healthcare Research Platform (BHRP)](docs/BHRP Requirements Analysis Document v2.0.pdf). This document serves as an introduction to what the project is about, provides functional and non-functional requirements, and common terminology used in the project.
- [RAD on GD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TX3htEBw8v2g3QqwKB5Z1JbZqfFPKIrNo6JsMrmDIw4/edit#)
- [Use Cases](docs/Use Cases.md) and general examples of how CARP can be used.
- [Privacy & Security in CARP](docs/Privacy & Security in CARP.md)


## Architecture
- [Definitions](docs/Definitions.md): contains common terminology used throughout the platform (extracted from the RAD above).
- [CARP Core](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.core-kotlin): The core domain model with all sub-systems.
- [CARP Mobile Sensing (CAMS)](docs/CARP Mobile Sensing.md) Framework
- [Repository design overview](docs/Repository design overview.md): Outlines the structure of the repositories in the CACHET Github, their naming structure, and how we use branches, issues, etc.
- We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for the different subsystems in the architecture.
- Relevant [standards](docs/Standards.md). 
- [Data application service endpoint and data point DTO](docs/Data application service endpoint and data point DTO.md)
