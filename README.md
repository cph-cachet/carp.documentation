This repository contains **internal & private** documentation on the CACHET Research Platform (CARP).
The only reason why it is public, is for us to use the wiki.

- [Wiki pages](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.documentation/wiki) are used to document the infrastructure.
- External documentation referred to from the wiki can be added to the repository.
