## Java/Kotlin naming convention

* use default Java naming convention (camelCase)
* namespaces are prefixed with the cachet domain name: `dk.cachet`. Thus: `dk.cachet.carp.<subsystem>.<component>`

## JSON Schemas

* use underscore (_) (instead of CamelCase) for JSON keys (similar to Open mHealth)


## Flutter packages / plugins

* when naming follow the [Flutter Team recommendations](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo).
    * use underscore (_) (instead of CamelCase ) in naming packages / plugins
    * DON'T add the name 'flutter' to the name - it goes without saying that this is a flutter package
* add general CACHET flutter packages / plugins to the [flutter-plugins](https://github.com/cph-cachet/flutter-plugins) repo.
