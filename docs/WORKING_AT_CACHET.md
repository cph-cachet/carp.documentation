# Working at CACHET

This page provide overall guides on how to work at CACHET (mostly as a student programmer).

## Who does what?

The answer to this question is tied to two fundamental aspects:

 * what project is **funding** your salary?
 * what are you **skills** and (research) interests?


Based on this, the following table tries to provide an overview.


Name      | Funding      | Skills      | Responsibility
:---------|:-------------|:------------|:----------------
Jakob     | DTU & [CACHET](https://www.cachet.dk) | SW Architecture, Mobile Sensing, Flutter, Android (iOS) programming, UX design | Overall architecture, [CAMS](https://carp.cachet.dk/cams/), app design
Steven    | [iMotions](https://imotions.com) | SW Architecture, Domain-driven design, Kotlin | Domain architecture, CARP Core
Alex      | [CACHET](https://www.cachet.dk) | Infrastructure, DevOps, Data Processing | Infrastructure, DevOps, Python libs
Aidana    | [CACHET](https://www.cachet.dk) | Spring Architecture, Kotlin | CAWS Spring implementation
Aamir     | [SOFIA](https://www.cachet.dk/research/research_projects/sofia) | React, JS, Design | CARP Study Portal
Kacper    | [SOFIA](https://www.cachet.dk/research/research_projects/sofia) | React, JS, Design | CARP Study Portal,  ICAT app
Mads      | [iPDM-GO](https://www.cachet.dk/research/research_projects/ipdm-go) | Mobile programming, Flutter | iPDM-GO app, Research Package, Flutter Plugins
Lars      | WristAngel | Mobile programming, Flutter, [CAMS](https://carp.cachet.dk/cams/) | Study App
Nerea     | [CACHET](https://www.cachet.dk) | UX & Graphical design | Web design, app design, graphic elements


Your work will be prioritised in this order:

1. if help is need in the project you're **funded** by, this has highest priority
2. you work on things that you have **skills** for 
3. you work on things that you **enjoy** 

Here are a few examples:

* Mads is working on the Research Package for the Study App, but there is an error in the DiaFocus app
  * .. then Mads drops what he is doing on RP and focuses on getting DiaFocus up and running
* Ossi enjoys working on DevOps issues on the CAWS server, but he has skills in React for helping with the CARP study portal
  * ... then he helps with the study portal
  * ... and if the people using ICAT needs support, he goes to the hospital and helps them

I hope this helps clarifying who does what. Feel free to ask questions.

## Working Rythms

DTU and CACHET has a working policy of **working in the lab**. Hence, you should to the largest extend possible work from the lab. This also fosters interaction and knowledge exchange -- it's much easier to turn around and ask a question if you're in the lab. Plus you build a shared awareness of what everybody is doing.

Having said this, you can also work some hours from home - especially, if you need to work during the weekend in order to align your work with your studies. 

Every Monday you should write in the **#office** channel on slack what your plans for working this week is -- something like:

`W14 :: Mon AM @DTU | Wed @DTU | Fri AM @Rigshospitalet (helping setting up study)`

## Reporting Hours

Normal working hour is **15 hours pr. week on average**. Sometime this is more, sometime less - again aligned with your studies. 15 hours is roughtly two days in the lab - 7 + 8 hours.

Hours are reported in the [DTU Allocation](https://adm-poss-nyprod.adm.dtu.dk/OA_HTML/RF.jsp?function_id=1026634&resp_id=-1&resp_appl_id=-1&security_group_id=0&lang_code=US&oas=oCPur8JXJfJ03LVDKGjClQ..&params=2bcAkfsfUgmJGAEXaCwXtw) system. 
You should report you **REAL** working hours (and not use the pre-specified hours).
There is a so-called "flex account" which track whether you're currently above or below you allocated number of hours.

You can also report vacation there. In the system you can see how many hours of vacation you have earned. Note that in Denmark, you earn vacation in year N to be spend in year N+1.


## Reimbursement

If you have to buy stuff, you can ask Bardram to buy it on a DTU credit card. You may also buy it on your own credit card (if approved by Bardram) and they you will be reimbursed. Questions for administrative stuff, incl. reimbursement should go to Christel Wagner <cwag@bioinformatics.dtu.dk>.
